# CITRARB--Web-FrontEnd
Coal City Connect Application Rehabilitation Web FrontEnd Codes

The project involves the rehabilitation of an existing android and web application known as Coal City Connect.
The applications entails connecting various people within a locale of Enugu State (the coal city) through various attributes like: news, events, chats, music, videos etc.
Some of the features exist and are functional on the existing mobile application while the web application is intended to be a news blog for news updates, engagement and interaction.

State of the Art:
The existing software exists on both Google Play Store as an android mobile application and on the internet as a website blog.
The existing mobile app lacks modernization in design, structure , functionality, management and more. When compared against the intended features, the existing software comes below par on its delivery, and does not solve any of the intended problems.
Apart from the front-end, the backend database and code seem to be lacking structure and maintenance. The data stored and fetched are not properly categorized while some other fetched data do not correspond to the intended view/ display.

TODO:
In respect to the above detailed description and state-of-the-art, the engagement of the Developer is to serve 3 purposes, all of which fall under the term 'rebranding'. The 3 purposes include the following procedures:

a. Backend Database and API Restructuring: A cloud database will be created with more optimization. The database will manage and provide consumable APIs to satisfy the application purpose.

b. Frontend Android Mobile Application Restructuring: A user-facing android mobile application. It will be a modification to the existing mobile application. The mobile application will manage, consume and present data from and to the backend database.

c. Frontend iOS Mobile Application Restructuring: A user-facing iOS mobile application. It will be a development of a replica of the new mobile application. The mobile application will manage, consume and present data from and to the backend database.

d. Frontend Web Application Restructuring: This will involve 2 web applications; for the news blog and for the admin management. The web application will communicate with the backend database to deliver the necessary data for the 2 interfaces.
Each of these procedures, in their way, serve the rebranding mechanisms of: user management, data management, content management and design management.
